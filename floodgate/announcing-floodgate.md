## What is Floodgate?

Just like the title says, **Floodgate** is a React-based "load more" component built using the [render-prop pattern](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/use-a-render-prop-50de598f11ce); it allows you to pass in an array of data, and leverage the component's functionality without losing control of your JSX structure or CSS styling.
